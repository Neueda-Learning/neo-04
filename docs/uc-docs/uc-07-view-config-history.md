# Module 4 · Fraud & AML Screening — UC 07 · View Config History

> AI implementation brief, generated from the v5 spec (`spec/.../use-cases/`). Source of truth is the spec; regenerate, don't hand-edit.

## Context

- Module: 4 · Fraud & AML Screening · category Rule · domain `screening` · command `screen-applicant` · outcomes: CLEAR, REVIEW, HIT
- Use case: 07 · View Config History · track C · prerequisite: after 05 · build shape: API+FE · primary screen: Watchlist Editor / Country Risk List
- Data effect: read-only
- Platform rules (non-negotiable): the orchestrator is the only caller; the whole application arrives in the envelope (plus the v5 `outputs` block, Option A); steps are independent and re-orderable; the payload is NEVER stored — only `applicationId`; every module ships `GET /cases/{id}/applicant` proxying the orchestrator; big lists are empty by default and capped at 10 rows (≤10 hydration calls); ALL APIs are idempotent — same request twice, same result once; every endpoint appears in the service's OpenAPI 3.0 (Swagger) spec.

## Story

As a bank employee I want to see every past version of the screening configuration so I can explain an old alert — which entries, which countries, which sampling rate, on the day it fired.

## Contract

```
GET /config/versions →
[{"version":1,
  "watchlist":[…3 entries…],
  "highRiskCountries":["IR","KP","SY","BY"],
  "sampleEvery":7,
  "effectiveFrom":"2026-07-01T…"},
 …oldest first, current last…]
```

## Acceptance criteria

1. GET /config/versions → 200 + every version, oldest first, each with the full watchlist, country list, sampleEvery and effectiveFrom.
2. The current version is flagged in the response.
3. After UC 05's and UC 06's demo inserts, the history shows v1, v2 and v3 with v3 current.  ⟵ **checkpoint — exact value**
4. An alert decided under v1 still displays v1's lists after v3 ships — the pin, not the current version, explains the alert.
5. Both editor screens show the shared history panel — selecting a version shows its full document read-only.

## Expected data changes

- **No rows change.** Reads screening_config only.
- Current = MAX(version) — computed, not stored.
- Pairs with UC 02: an alert's pinned version deep-links here to show the lists that decided it.

### Entity model (suggested — the shape to beat)

![Entity model](diagrams/er-suggested.jpg)

**ScreeningRecord — one row per decision; applicationId is the only applicant identifier**

| field | type | key | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| applicationId | string | PK | the journey key from the envelope — the ONLY applicant-related column in this schema |
| outcome | enum |  | the final answer: CLEAR, REVIEW or HIT — starts equal to machineOutcome; only an analyst decision or override can change it |
| machineOutcome | enum |  | what rules 1–3 computed before sampling — kept so the analyst always sees the machine's own answer |
| reference | string |  | human-facing alert reference shown on every screen and in the callback, e.g. scr-000342 |
| screeningConfigVersion | int | FK | the ScreeningConfig version (watchlist + country list) this alert was matched against — pinned forever, never re-pointed |
| matchedEntryId | string, nullable |  | the watchlist entry an exact match hit, e.g. WL-001; null when no entry matched |
| matchResults | JSON |  | the evidence: normalisedName as actually compared, candidates[] with matched fields and verdict for EVERY entry considered (near-misses included), countryRisk, sampling |
| claimedBy | string, nullable |  | analyst queue — the analyst who claimed the alert; null when unclaimed or released |
| claimedAt | timestamp, nullable |  | analyst queue — when the alert was claimed |
| resolvedBy | string, nullable |  | who made the human decision (queue clear/confirm or override) |
| resolvedAt | timestamp, nullable |  | when the human decision was made |
| resolution | enum, nullable |  | which exit the analyst took: CLEARED or CONFIRMED; null while the alert is open |
| resolutionReason | string, nullable |  | the mandatory reason recorded with every analyst decision |
| submittedAt | timestamp |  | when the orchestrator submitted the case |

**ScreeningConfig — insert-only, versioned lists; the current version is the highest**

| field | type | key | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| version | int | PK | one new row per change — rows are inserted, never updated; current = MAX(version) |
| watchlist | JSON |  | array of {entryId, fullName, dateOfBirth, listType}; seeded WL-001 Marek Nowak 1961-04-19 · WL-002 Viktor Orlov 1975-08-22 · WL-003 Amara Diallo 1969-02-10, all SANCTIONS |
| highRiskCountries | JSON |  | ISO alpha-2 codes whose residents park REVIEW under rule 3 (seeded [IR, KP, SY, BY]) |
| sampleEvery | int |  | rule 4's X — every Xth first-time decision parks for an analyst, whatever the rules said (seeded 7) |
| fuzzyThreshold | int, nullable |  | the fuzzy-distance upgrade's dial — no locked rule reads it; locked matching is exact-after-normalisation |
| effectiveFrom | timestamp |  | when this version became the current one |

**OverrideLog — audit trail; one row per manual override, none ever deleted**

| field | type | key | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| applicationId | string | FK | the alert that was overridden |
| oldOutcome | enum |  | the outcome before the override |
| newOutcome | enum |  | the outcome after the override |
| reason | string |  | the mandatory justification typed by the operator |
| operator | string |  | who performed the override |
| overriddenAt | timestamp |  | when it happened |

Relationships: ScreeningRecord N:1 ScreeningConfig — every alert pins the config version it matched against · ScreeningRecord 1:N OverrideLog — every manual override is audited against its alert

## Out of scope

Diffing versions in the UI; restoring an old version (create a new one instead).

## Build notes

Plain read over screening_config ordered by version; mark the current (MAX) row so the UI can badge it. Rendered as a shared history panel on BOTH editor screens — one config document, one history. An alert's pinned screeningConfigVersion deep-links here from Alert Detail.

## Tests

Repository test: ordering, current marked, seed guarantees v1.

## Definition of done

All acceptance criteria verified against the running app · `./mvnw test` green · teammate-reviewed PR merged to main · fresh clone builds green · endpoint idempotent + present in the OpenAPI 3.0 (Swagger) spec · demoable from the UI.
