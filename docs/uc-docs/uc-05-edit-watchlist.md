# Module 4 · Fraud & AML Screening — UC 05 · Edit Watchlist

> AI implementation brief, generated from the v5 spec (`spec/.../use-cases/`). Source of truth is the spec; regenerate, don't hand-edit.

## Context

- Module: 4 · Fraud & AML Screening · category Rule · domain `screening` · command `screen-applicant` · outcomes: CLEAR, REVIEW, HIT
- Use case: 05 · Edit Watchlist · track C · prerequisite: none (independent) · build shape: DB-write→API→FE · primary screen: Watchlist Editor
- Data effect: insert-only
- Platform rules (non-negotiable): the orchestrator is the only caller; the whole application arrives in the envelope (plus the v5 `outputs` block, Option A); steps are independent and re-orderable; the payload is NEVER stored — only `applicationId`; every module ships `GET /cases/{id}/applicant` proxying the orchestrator; big lists are empty by default and capped at 10 rows (≤10 hydration calls); ALL APIs are idempotent — same request twice, same result once; every endpoint appears in the service's OpenAPI 3.0 (Swagger) spec.

## Story

As a compliance officer I want to add or remove watchlist entries without a deploy — a new sanctions designation must screen against the very next applicant.

## Contract

```
POST /config
{"watchlist":[{"entryId":"WL-001",
   "fullName":"Marek Nowak",
   "dateOfBirth":"1961-04-19",
   "listType":"SANCTIONS"}, …],
 "highRiskCountries":["IR","KP","SY","BY"],
 "sampleEvery":7}
→ 201 + {version: 2}
```

## Acceptance criteria

1. POST /config with the full document → 201; a NEW version row is inserted — never an update.
2. Version numbers increment from the seeded v1.
3. Seed data: v1 exists on first boot — WL-001 Marek Nowak 1961-04-19, WL-002 Viktor Orlov 1975-08-22, WL-003 Amara Diallo 1969-02-10, all SANCTIONS.  ⟵ **checkpoint — exact value**
4. Invalid payload (duplicate entryId, blank fullName, future DOB, unknown listType) → 400 with field-level errors.
5. The next /execute matches against the new version; alerts decided earlier still show the version they used.
6. Adding an entry matching the demo applicant makes the very next /execute for them a HIT — demo-able live.
7. The "test a name" box returns what the CURRENT list would decide for a typed name+DOB — normalised exactly like the engine — without creating a case or a callback.

## Expected data changes

- **INSERT screening_config** row with version = MAX + 1 — the whole document, both lists and sampleEvery together.
- **Never UPDATE, never DELETE** — history is the audit trail.
- Existing screening_record rows are untouched — their pinned screeningConfigVersion keeps old alerts explainable.

### Entity model (suggested — the shape to beat)

![Entity model](diagrams/er-suggested.jpg)

**ScreeningRecord — one row per decision; applicationId is the only applicant identifier**

| field | type | key | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| applicationId | string | PK | the journey key from the envelope — the ONLY applicant-related column in this schema |
| outcome | enum |  | the final answer: CLEAR, REVIEW or HIT — starts equal to machineOutcome; only an analyst decision or override can change it |
| machineOutcome | enum |  | what rules 1–3 computed before sampling — kept so the analyst always sees the machine's own answer |
| reference | string |  | human-facing alert reference shown on every screen and in the callback, e.g. scr-000342 |
| screeningConfigVersion | int | FK | the ScreeningConfig version (watchlist + country list) this alert was matched against — pinned forever, never re-pointed |
| matchedEntryId | string, nullable |  | the watchlist entry an exact match hit, e.g. WL-001; null when no entry matched |
| matchResults | JSON |  | the evidence: normalisedName as actually compared, candidates[] with matched fields and verdict for EVERY entry considered (near-misses included), countryRisk, sampling |
| claimedBy | string, nullable |  | analyst queue — the analyst who claimed the alert; null when unclaimed or released |
| claimedAt | timestamp, nullable |  | analyst queue — when the alert was claimed |
| resolvedBy | string, nullable |  | who made the human decision (queue clear/confirm or override) |
| resolvedAt | timestamp, nullable |  | when the human decision was made |
| resolution | enum, nullable |  | which exit the analyst took: CLEARED or CONFIRMED; null while the alert is open |
| resolutionReason | string, nullable |  | the mandatory reason recorded with every analyst decision |
| submittedAt | timestamp |  | when the orchestrator submitted the case |

**ScreeningConfig — insert-only, versioned lists; the current version is the highest**

| field | type | key | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| version | int | PK | one new row per change — rows are inserted, never updated; current = MAX(version) |
| watchlist | JSON |  | array of {entryId, fullName, dateOfBirth, listType}; seeded WL-001 Marek Nowak 1961-04-19 · WL-002 Viktor Orlov 1975-08-22 · WL-003 Amara Diallo 1969-02-10, all SANCTIONS |
| highRiskCountries | JSON |  | ISO alpha-2 codes whose residents park REVIEW under rule 3 (seeded [IR, KP, SY, BY]) |
| sampleEvery | int |  | rule 4's X — every Xth first-time decision parks for an analyst, whatever the rules said (seeded 7) |
| fuzzyThreshold | int, nullable |  | the fuzzy-distance upgrade's dial — no locked rule reads it; locked matching is exact-after-normalisation |
| effectiveFrom | timestamp |  | when this version became the current one |

**OverrideLog — audit trail; one row per manual override, none ever deleted**

| field | type | key | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| applicationId | string | FK | the alert that was overridden |
| oldOutcome | enum |  | the outcome before the override |
| newOutcome | enum |  | the outcome after the override |
| reason | string |  | the mandatory justification typed by the operator |
| operator | string |  | who performed the override |
| overriddenAt | timestamp |  | when it happened |

Relationships: ScreeningRecord N:1 ScreeningConfig — every alert pins the config version it matched against · ScreeningRecord 1:N OverrideLog — every manual override is audited against its alert

## Out of scope

Deleting or editing an existing version (insert-only); bulk list imports; list-type weights (candidate territory).

## Build notes

current = MAX(version) — no is_current flag. A version is the WHOLE config document: watchlist, country list, sampleEvery — this UC edits the watchlist part, UC 06 the countries; both POST the full document. Validation: entryId unique, fullName non-blank, dateOfBirth a real past date, listType known. The "test a name" box calls the matcher read-only against the current version — no case is created.

## Tests

Repository test: version increments; validation 400s (duplicate entryId, blank name); matcher picks up the new current version on the next /execute; test-a-name creates no row.

## Definition of done

All acceptance criteria verified against the running app · `./mvnw test` green · teammate-reviewed PR merged to main · fresh clone builds green · endpoint idempotent + present in the OpenAPI 3.0 (Swagger) spec · demoable from the UI.
